&emsp;“Si veris magna paratur<br>
Fama bonis, et si successu nuda remoto<br>
Inspicitur virtus, quicquid laudamus in ullo<br>
Majorum, fortuna fuit.”<br>
<div align="right">—<i>Lucan.</i></div><br><br/>

Whilst martial echoes o’er the wave resound,<br/>
And Europe’s gore incarnadines the ground;<br/>
Today no foreign hero we bemoan,<br/>
But count the glowing virtues of our own!<br/>
Illustrious LEE! around whose honour’d name<br/>
Entwines a patriot’s and a Christian’s fame;<br/>
With whose just praise admiring nations ring,<br/>
And whom repenting foes contritely sing!<br/>
When first our land fraternal fury bore,<br/>
And Sumter’s guns alarm’d the anxious shore;<br/>
When Faction’s reign ancestral rights o’erthrew,<br/>
And sunder’d States a mutual hatred knew;<br/>
Then clash’d contending chiefs of kindred line,<br/>
In flesh to suffer and in fame to shine.<br/>
But o’er them all, majestic in his might,<br/>
Rose LEE, unrivall’d, to sublimest height:<br/>
With torturing choice defy’d opposing Fate,<br/>
And shunn’d Temptation for his native State!<br/>
Thus Washington his monarch’s rule o’erturn’d<br/>
When young Columbia with rebellion burn’d.<br/>
And what in Washington the world reveres,<br/>
In LEE with equal magnitude appears.<br/>
Our nation’s Father, crown’d with vict’ry’s bays,<br/>
Enjoys a loving land’s eternal praise:<br/>
Let, then, our hearts with equal rev’rence greet<br/>
His proud successor, rising o’er defeat!<br/>
Around his greatness pour disheartening woes,<br/>
But still he tow’rs above his conqu’ring foes.<br/>
Silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blame<br/>
Th’ unspotted leader by a traitor’s name:<br/>
If such was LEE, let blushing Justice mourn,<br/>
And trait’rous Liberty endure our scorn!<br/>
As Philopoemen once sublimely strove,<br/>
And earn’d declining Hellas’ thankful love;<br/>
So follow’d LEE the purest patriot’s part,<br/>
And wak’d the worship of the grateful heart:<br/>
The South her soul in body’d form discerns;<br/>
The North from LEE a nobler freedom learns!<br/>
Attend! ye sons of Albion’s ancient race,<br/>
Whate’er your country, and whate’er your place:<br/>
LEE’S valiant deeds, tho’ dear to Southern song,<br/>
To all our Saxon strain as well belong.<br/>
Courage like his the parent Island won,<br/>
And led an Empire past the setting sun;<br/>
To realms unknown our laws and language bore;<br/>
Rais’d England’s banner on the desert shore;<br/>
Crush’d the proud rival, and subdu’d the sea<br/>
For ages past, and aeons yet to be!<br/>
From Scotia’s hilly bounds the paean rolls,<br/>
And Afric’s distant Cape great LEE extols;<br/>
The sainted soul and manly mien combine<br/>
To grace Britannia’s and Virginia's line!<br/>
As dullards now in thoughtless fervour prate<br/>
Of shameful peace, and sing th’ unmanly State;<br/>
As churls their piping reprobations shriek,<br/>
And damn the heroes that protect the weak;<br/>
Let LEE’S brave shade the timid throng accost,<br/>
And give them back the manhood they have lost!<br/>
What kindlier spirit, breathing from on high,<br/>
Can teach us how to live and how to die?
