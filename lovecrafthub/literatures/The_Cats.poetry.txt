Babels of blocks to the high heavens tow’ring,<br>
&emsp;Flames of futility swirling below;<br>
Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flow’ring,<br>
&emsp;Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.<br><br/>

Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,<br/>
&emsp;Cobwebs of cable by nameless things spun;<br/>
Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos delivers<br/>
&emsp;Streams of live foetor, that rots in the sun.<br/><br/>

Colour and splendour, disease and decaying,<br/>
&emsp;Shrieking and ringing and scrambling insane,<br/>
Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying,<br/>
&emsp;Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain.<br/><br/>

Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal,<br/>
&emsp;Howling and lean in the glare of the moon,<br/>
Screaming the future with mouthings infernal,<br/>
&emsp;Yelling the burden of Pluto’s red rune.<br/><br/>

Tall tow’rs and pyramids ivy’d and crumbling,<br/>
&emsp;Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber’d streets;<br/>
Bleak broken bridges o’er rivers whose rumbling<br/>
&emsp;Joins with no voice as the thick tide retreats.<br/><br/>

Belfries that blackly against the moon totter,<br/>
&emsp;Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac’d,<br/>
And living to answer the wind and the water,<br/>
&emsp;Only the lean cats that howl in the waste!<br/>
