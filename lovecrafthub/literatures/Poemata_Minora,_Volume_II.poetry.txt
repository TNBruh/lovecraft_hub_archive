<b><i>Ode to Selene or Diana</i></b><br><br>

Immortal Moon, in maiden splendour shine.<br>
Dispense thy beams, divine <i>Latona’s</i> child.<br>
Thy silver rays all grosser things define,<br/>
And hide harsh truth in sweet illusion mild.<br/><br/>

In thy soft light, the city of unrest<br/>
That stands so squalid in thy brother’s glare<br/>
Throws off its habit, and in silence blest<br/>
Becomes a vision, sparkling bright and fair.<br/><br/>

The modern world, with all it’s care &amp; pain,<br/>
The smoky streets, the hideous clanging mills,<br/>
Face ’neath thy beams, <i>Selene,</i> and again<br/>
We dream like shepherds on <i>Chaldæa’s</i> hills.<br/><br/>

Take heed, <i>Diana,</i> of my humble plea.<br/>
Convey me where my happiness may last.<br/>
Draw me against the tide of time’s rough sea<br/>
And let my sprirt rest amid the past.<br/><br/><br/>
<b><i>To the Old Pagan Religion</i></b><br/><br/>

Olympian gods! How can I let ye go<br/>
And pin my faith to this new <i>Christian</i> creed?<br/>
Can I resign the deities I know<br/>
For him who on a cross for man did bleed?<br/><br/>

How in my weakness can my hopes depend<br/>
On one lone God, though mighty be his pow’r?<br/>
Why can <i>Jove’s</i> host no more assistance lend,<br/>
To soothe my pain, and cheer my troubled hour?<br/><br/>

Are there no Dryads on these wooded mounts<br/>
O’er which I oft in desolation roam?<br/>
Are there no Naiads in these crystal founts?<br/>
Nor Nereids upon the Ocean foam?<br/><br/>

Fast spreads the new; the older faith declines.<br/>
The name of <i>Christ</i> resounds upon the air.<br/>
But my wrack’d soul in solitude repines<br/>
And gives the Gods their last-receivèd pray’r.<br/><br/><br/>
<b><i>On the Ruin of Rome</i></b><br/><br/>

Low dost thou lie, O <i>Rome,</i> neath the foot of the <i>Teuton</i><br/>
Slaves are thy men, and bent to the will of thy conqueror:<br/>
Wither hath gone, great city, the race that gave law to all nations,<br/>
Subdu’d the east and the west, and made them bow down to thy consuls.<br/>
Knew not defeat, but gave it to all who attack’d thee?<br/><br/>

Dead! and replac’d by these wretches who cower in confusion<br/>
Dead! They who gave us this empire to guard and to live in<br/>
<i>Rome,</i> thou didst fall from thy pow’r with the proud race that made thee,<br/>
And we, base <i>Italians,</i> enjoy’d what we could not have builded.<br/><br/><br/>
<b><i>To Pan</i></b><br/><br/>

Seated in a woodland glen<br/>
By a shallow reedy stream<br/>
Once I fell a-musing, when<br/>
I was lull’d into a dream.<br/><br/>

From the brook a shape arose<br/>
Half a man and half a goat.<br/>
Hoofs it had instead of toes<br/>
And a beard adorn’d its throat<br/><br/>

On a set of rustic reeds<br/>
Sweetly play’d this hybrid man<br/>
Naught car’d  I for earthly needs,<br/>
For I knew that this was <i>Pan</i><br/><br/>

Nymphs &amp; Satyrs gather’d ’round<br/>
To enjoy the lively sound.<br/><br/>

All to soon I woke in pain<br/>
And return’d to haunts of men.<br/>
But in rural vales I’d fain<br/>
Live and hear <i>Pan’s</i> pipes again.<br/><br/><br/>
<b><i>On the Vanity of Human Ambition</i></b><br/><br/>
<i>Apollo,</i> chasing <i>Daphne,</i> gain’d his prize<br/>
But lo! she turn’d to wood before his eyes.<br/>
More modern swains at golden prizes aim,<br/>
And ever strive some worldly thing to claim.<br/>
Yet ’tis the same as in <i>Apollo’s</i> case,<br/>
For, once attain’d, the purest gold seems base.<br/>
All that men seek ’s unworthy of the quest,<br/>
Yet seek they will, and never pause for rest.<br/>
True bliss, methinks, a man can only find<br/>
In virtuous life, &amp; cultivated mind.
