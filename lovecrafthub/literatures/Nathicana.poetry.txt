It was in the pale garden of Zaïs;<br>
The mist-shrouded gardens of Zaïs,<br>
Where blossoms the white nephalotë,<br>
The redolent herald of midnight.<br>
There slumber the still lakes of crystal,<br/>
And streamlets that flow without murm’ring;<br/>
Smooth streamlets from caverns of Kathos<br/>
Where brood the calm spirits of twilight.<br/>
And over the lakes and the streamlets<br/>
Are bridges of pure alabaster,<br/>
White bridges all cunningly carven<br/>
With figures of fairies and daemons.<br/>
Here glimmer strange suns and strange planets,<br/>
And strange is the crescent Banapis<br/>
That sets ’yond the ivy-grown ramparts<br/>
Where thickens the dust of the evening.<br/>
Here fall the white vapours of Yabon;<br/>
And here in the swirl of vapours<br/>
I saw the divine Nathicana;<br/>
The garlanded, white Nathicana;<br/>
The slender, black-hair’d Nathicana;<br/>
The sloe-ey’d, red-lipp’d Nathicana;<br/>
The silver-voic’d, sweet Nathicana;<br/>
The pale-rob’d, belov’d Nathicana.<br/>
And ever was she my belovèd,<br/>
From ages when Time was unfashion’d;<br/>
From days when the stars were not fashion’d<br/>
Nor any thing fashion’d but Yabon.<br/>
And here dwelt we ever and ever,<br/>
The innocent children of Zaïs,<br/>
At peace in the paths and the arbours,<br/>
White-crown’d with the blest nephalotë.<br/>
How oft would we float in the twilight<br/>
O’er flow’r-cover’d pastures and hillsides<br/>
All white with the lowly astalthon;<br/>
The lowly yet lovely astalthon,<br/>
And dream in a world made of dreaming<br/>
The dreams that are fairer than Aidenn;<br/>
Bright dreams that are truer than reason!<br/>
So dream’d and so lov’d we thro’ ages,<br/>
Till came the curs’d season of Dzannin;<br/>
The daemon-damn’d season of Dzannin;<br/>
When red shone the suns and the planets,<br/>
And red gleamed the crescent Banapis,<br/>
And red fell the vapours of Yabon.<br/>
Then redden’d the blossoms and streamlets<br/>
And lakes that lay under the bridges,<br/>
And even the calm alabaster<br/>
Glow’d pink with uncanny reflections<br/>
Till all the carv’d fairies and daemons<br/>
Leer’d redly from the backgrounds of shadow.<br/>
Now redden’d my vision, and madly<br/>
I strove to peer thro’ the dense curtain<br/>
And glimpse the divine Nathicana;<br/>
The pure, ever-pale Nathicana;<br/>
The lov’d, the unchang’d Nathicana.<br/>
But vortex on vortex of madness<br/>
Beclouded my labouring vision;<br/>
My damnable, reddening vision<br/>
That built a new world for my seeing;<br/>
A new world of redness and darkness,<br/>
A horrible coma call’d living.<br/>
So now in this coma call’d living<br/>
I view the bright phantons of beauty;<br/>
The false, hollow phantoms of beauty<br/>
That cloak all the evils of Dzannin.<br/>
I view them with infinite longing,<br/>
So like do they seem to my lov’d one;<br/>
So shapely and fair like my lov’d one;<br/>
Yet foul from their eyes shines their evil;<br/>
Their cruel and pitiless evil,<br/>
More evil than Thaphron and Latgoz,<br/>
Twice ill for its gorgeous concealment.<br/>
And only in slumbers of midnight<br/>
Appears the lost maid Nathicana,<br/>
The pallid, the pure Nathicana,<br/>
Who fades at the glance of the dreamer.<br/>
Again and again do I seek her;<br/>
I woo with deep draughts of Plathotis,<br/>
Deep draughts brew’d in wine of Astarte<br/>
And strengthen’d with tears of long weeping.<br/>
I yearn for the gardens of Zaïs;<br/>
The lovely lost garden of Zaïs<br/>
Where blossoms the white nephalotë,<br/>
The redolent herald of midnight.<br/>
The last potent draught I am brewing;<br/>
A draught that the daemons delight in;<br/>
A draught that will banish the redness;<br/>
The horrible coma call’d living.<br/>
Soon, soon, if I fail not in brewing,<br/>
The redness and madness will vanish,<br/>
And deep in the worm-peopled darkness<br/>
Will rot the base chains that hav bound me.<br/>
Once more shall the gardens of Zaïs<br/>
Dawn white on my long-tortur’d vision,<br/>
And there midst the vapours of Yabon<br/>
Will stand the divine Nathicana;<br/>
The deathless, restor’d Nathicana<br/>
Whose like is not met with in living.
