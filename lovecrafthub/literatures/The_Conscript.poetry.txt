I am a peaceful working man—<br>
&emsp;I am not wise or strong—<br>
But I can follow Nature’s plan<br>
&emsp;In labour, rest, and song.<br><br/>

One day the men that rule us all<br/>
&emsp;Decided we must die,<br/>
Else pride and freedom surely fall<br/>
&emsp;In the dim bye and bye.<br/><br/>

They told me I must write my name<br/>
&emsp;Upon a scroll of death;<br/>
That some day I should rise to fame<br/>
&emsp;By giving up my breath.<br/><br/>

I do not know what I have done<br/>
&emsp;That I should thus be bound<br/>
To wait for tortures one by one,<br/>
&emsp;And then an unmark’d mound.<br/><br/>

I hate no man, and yet they say<br/>
&emsp;That I must fight and kill;<br/>
That I must suffer day by day<br/>
&emsp;To please a master’s will.<br/><br/>

I used to have a conscience free,<br/>
&emsp;But now they bid it rest;<br/>
They’ve made a number out of me,<br/>
&emsp;And I must ne’er protest.<br/><br/>

They tell of trenches, long and deep,<br/>
&emsp;Fill’d with the mangled slain;<br/>
They talk till I can scarcely sleep,<br/>
&emsp;So reeling is my brain.<br/><br/>

They tell of filth, and blood, and woe;<br/>
&emsp;Of things beyond belief;<br/>
Of things that make me tremble so<br/>
&emsp;With mingled fright and grief.<br/><br/>

I do not know what I shall do—<br/>
&emsp;Is not the law unjust?<br/>
I can’t do what they want me to,<br/>
&emsp;And yet they say I must!<br/><br/>

Each day my doom doth nearer bring;<br/>
&emsp;Each day the State prepares;<br/>
Sometimes I feel a watching thing<br/>
&emsp;That stares, and stares, and stares.<br/><br/>

I never seem to sleep—my head<br/>
&emsp;Whirls in the queerest way.<br/>
Why am I chosen to be dead<br/>
&emsp;Upon some fateful day?<br/><br/>

Yet hark—some fibre is o’erwrought—<br/>
&emsp;A giddying wine I quaff—<br/>
Things seem so odd, I can do naught<br/>
&emsp;But laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
