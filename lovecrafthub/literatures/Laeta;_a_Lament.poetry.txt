Respectfully Dedicated to Rheinhart Kleiner, Esq.<br>
With Compliments of the Author<br><br>

How sad droop the willows by Zulal’s fair side,<br>
Where so lately I stray’d with my raven-hair’d bride:<br/>
Ev’ry light-floating lily, each flow’r on the shore,<br/>
Folds in sorrow since Laeta can see them no more!<br/><br/>

Oh, blest were the days when in childhood and hope<br/>
With my Laeta I rov’d o’er the blossom-clad slope,<br/>
Plucking white meadow-daisies and ferns by the stream,<br/>
As we laugh’d at the ripples that twinkle and gleam.<br/><br/>

Not a bloom deck’d the mead that could rival in grace<br/>
The dear innocent charms of my Laeta’s fair face;<br/>
Not a thrush thrill’d the grove with a carol so choice<br/>
As the silvery strains of my Laeta’s sweet voice.<br/><br/>

The shy Nymphs of the woodland, the fount and the plain,<br/>
Strove to equal her beauty, but strove all in vain;<br/>
Yet no envy they bore her, while fruitless they strove,<br/>
For so pure was my Laeta, they could only love!<br/><br/>

When the warm breath of Auster play’d soft o’er the flow’rs,<br/>
And young Zephyrus rustled the gay scented bow’rs,<br/>
Ev’ry breeze seem’d to pause as it drew near the fair,<br/>
Too much aw’d at her sweetness to tumble her hair.<br/><br/>

How fond were our dreams on the day when we stood<br/>
In the ivy-grown temple beside the dark wood;<br/>
When our pledges we seal’d at the sanctify’d shrine,<br/>
And I knew that my Laeta forever was mine!<br/><br/>

How blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came,<br/>
And the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame;<br/>
Yet how heavy my heart when I first felt the fear<br/>
That my starry-eyed Laeta would fade with the year!<br/><br/>

The pastures were sere and the heavens were grey<br/>
When I laid my lov’d Laeta forever away,<br/>
And the river god pity’d, as weeping I pac’d<br/>
Mingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste.<br/><br/>

Now the flow’rs have return’d, but they bloom not so sweet<br/>
As in days when they blossom’d round Laeta’s dear feet;<br/>
And the willows complain to the answering hill,<br/>
And the thrushes that once were so happy are still.<br/><br/>

The green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine,<br/>
Whilst the Dryads no more in their madrigals join,<br/>
The breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs,<br/>
And blows soft o’er the spot where my lov’d Laeta lies.<br/><br/>

So pensive I roam o’er the desolate lawn<br/>
Where we wander’d and lov’d in the days that are gone,<br/>
And I yearn for the autumn, when Zulal’s blue tide<br/>
Shall sing low by my grave at the lov’d Laeta’s side.<br/>
