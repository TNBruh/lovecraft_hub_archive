O’er the midnight moorlands crying,<br>
Thro’ the cypress forests sighing,<br>
In the night-wind madly flying,<br>
&emsp;Hellish forms with streaming hair;<br>
In the barren branches creaking,<br/>
By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,<br/>
Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking;<br/>
&emsp;Damn’d daemons of despair.<br/><br/>

Once, I think I half remember,<br/>
Ere the grey skies of November<br/>
Quench’d my youth’s aspiring ember,<br/>
&emsp;Liv’d there such a thing as bliss;<br/>
Skies that now are dark were beaming,<br/>
Gold and azure, splendid seeming<br/>
Till I learn’d it all was dreaming—<br/>
&emsp;Deadly drowsiness of Dis.<br/><br/>

But the stream of Time, swift flowing,<br/>
Brings the torment of half-knowing—<br/>
Dimly rushing, blindly going<br/>
&emsp;Past the never-trodden lea;<br/>
And the voyager, repining,<br/>
Sees the wicked death-fires shining,<br/>
Hears the wicked petrel’s whining<br/>
&emsp;As he helpless drifts to sea.<br/><br/>

Evil wings in ether beating;<br/>
Vultures at the spirit eating;<br/>
Things unseen forever fleeting<br/>
&emsp;Black against the leering sky.<br/>
Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,<br/>
Clawing fiends of future sadness,<br/>
Mingle in a cloud of madness<br/>
&emsp;Ever on the soul to lie.<br/><br/>

Thus the living, lone and sobbing,<br/>
In the throes of anguish throbbing,<br/>
With the loathsome Furies robbing<br/>
&emsp;Night and noon of peace and rest.<br/>
But beyond the groans and grating<br/>
Of abhorrent Life, is waiting<br/>
Sweet Oblivion, culminating<br/>
&emsp;All the years of fruitless quest.
