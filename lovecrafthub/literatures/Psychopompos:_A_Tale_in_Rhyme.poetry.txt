I am He who howls in the night;<br>
&emsp;I am He who moans in the snow;<br>
I am He who hath never seen light;<br>
&emsp;I am He who mounts from below.<br><br/>

My car is the car of Death;<br/>
&emsp;My wings are the wings of dread;<br/>
My breath is the north wind’s breath;<br/>
&emsp;My prey are the cold and the dead.<br/><br/>

In old Auvergne, when schools were poor and few,<br/>
And peasants fancy’d what they scarcely knew,<br/>
When lords and gentry shunn’d their Monarch’s throne<br/>
For solitary castles of their own,<br/>
There dwelt a man of rank, whose fortress stood<br/>
In the hush’d twilight of a hoary wood.<br/>
De Blois his name; his lineage high and vast,<br/>
A proud memorial of an honour’d past;<br/>
But curious swains would whisper now and then<br/>
That Sieur De Blois was not as other men.<br/>
In person dark and lean, with glossy hair,<br/>
And gleaming teeth that he would often bare,<br/>
With piercing eye, and stealthy roving glance,<br/>
And tongue that clipt the soft, sweet speech of France;<br/>
The Sieur was little lov’d and seldom seen,<br/>
So close he kept within his own demesne.<br/>
The castle servants, few, discreet, and old,<br/>
Full many a tale of strangeness might have told;<br/>
But bow’d with years, they rarely left the door<br/>
Wherein their sires and grandsires serv’d before.<br/>
Thus gossip rose, as gossip rises best,<br/>
When mystery imparts a keener zest;<br/>
Seclusion oft the poison tongue attracts,<br/>
And scandal prospers on a dearth of facts.<br/>
’Twas said, the Sieur had more than once been spy’d<br/>
Alone at midnight by the river’s side,<br/>
With aspect so uncouth, and gaze so strange,<br/>
That rustics cross’d themselves to see the change;<br/>
Yet none, when press’d, could clearly say or know<br/>
Just what it was, or why they trembled so.<br/>
De Blois, as rumour whisper’d, fear’d to pray,<br/>
Nor us’d his chapel on the Sabbath day;<br/>
Howe’er this may have been, ’twas known at least<br/>
His household had no chaplain, monk, or priest.<br/>
But if the Master liv’d in dubious fame,<br/>
Twice fear’d and hated was his noble Dame;<br/>
As dark as he, in features wild and proud,<br/>
And with a weird supernal grace endow’d,<br/>
The haughty mistress scorn’d the rural train<br/>
Who sought to learn her source, but sought in vain.<br/>
Old women call’d her eyes too bright by half,<br/>
And nervous children shiver’d at her laugh;<br/>
Richard, the dwarf (whose word had little weight),<br/>
Vow’d she was like a serpent in her gait,<br/>
Whilst ancient Pierre (the aged often err)<br/>
Laid all her husband’s mystery to her.<br/>
Still more absurd were those odd mutter’d things<br/>
That calumny to curious list’ners brings;<br/>
Those subtle slanders, told with downcast face,<br/>
And muffled voice—those tales no man may trace;<br/>
Tales that the faith of old wives can command,<br/>
Tho’ always heard at sixth or seventh hand.<br/>
Thus village legend darkly would imply<br/>
That Dame De Blois possess’d an evil eye;<br/>
Or going further, furtively suggest<br/>
A lurking spark of sorcery in her breast;<br/>
Old Mère Allard (herself half witch) once said<br/>
The lady’s glance work’d strangely on the dead.<br/>
So liv’d the pair, like many another two<br/>
That shun the crowd, and shrink from public view.<br/>
They scorn’d the doubts by ev’ry peasant shewn,<br/>
And ask’d but one thing—to be let alone!<br/><br/>

’Twas Candlemas, the dreariest time of year,<br/>
With fall long gone, and spring too far to cheer,<br/>
When little Jean, the bailiff’s son and heir,<br/>
Fell sick and threw the doctors in despair.<br/>
A child so stout and strong that few would think<br/>
An hour might carry him to death’s dark brink,<br/>
Yet pale he lay, tho’ hidden was the cause,<br/>
And Galens search’d in vain thro’ Nature’s laws.<br/>
But stricken sadness could not quite suppress<br/>
The roving thought, or wrinkled grandam’s guess:<br/>
Tho’ spoke by stealth, ’twas known to half a score<br/>
That Dame De Blois rode by the day before;<br/>
She had (they said) with glances weird and wild<br/>
Paus’d by the gate to view the prattling child,<br/>
Nor did they like the smile which seem’d to trace<br/>
New lines of evil on her proud, dark face.<br/>
These things they whisper’d, when the mother’s cry<br/>
Told of the end—the gentle soul gone by;<br/>
In genuine grief the kindly watcher wept,<br/>
Whilst the lov’d babe with saints and angels slept.<br/>
The village priest his simple rites went thro’,<br/>
And good Michel nail’d up the box of yew;<br/>
Around the corpse the holy candles burn’d,<br/>
The mourners sighed, the parents dumbly yearn’d.<br/>
Then one by one each sought his humble bed,<br/>
And left the lonely mother with her dead.<br/>
Late in the night it was, when o’er the vale<br/>
The storm-king swept with pandemoniac gale;<br/>
Deep pil’d the cruel snow, yet strange to tell,<br/>
The lightning sputter’d while the white flakes fell;<br/>
A hideous presence seem’d abroad to steal,<br/>
And terror sounded in the thunder’s peal.<br/>
Within the house of grief the tapers glow’d<br/>
Whilst the poor mother bow’d beneath her load;<br/>
Her salty eyes too tired now to weep,<br/>
Too pain’d to see, too sad to close in sleep.<br/>
The clock struck three, above the tempest heard,<br/>
When something near the lifeless infant stirr’d;<br/>
Some slipp’ry thing, that flopp’d in awkward way,<br/>
And climb’d the table where the coffin lay;<br/>
With scaly convolutions strove to find<br/>
The cold, still clay that death had left behind.<br/>
The nodding mother hears—starts broad awake—<br/>
Empower’d to reason, yet too stunn’d to shake;<br/>
The pois’nous thing she sees, and nimbly foils<br/>
The ghoulish purpose of the quiv’ring coils:<br/>
With ready axe the serpent’s head she cleaves,<br/>
And thrills with savage triumph whilst she grieves.<br/>
The injur’d reptile hissing glides from sight,<br/>
And hides its cloven carcass in the night.<br/><br/>

The weeks slipp’d by, and gossip’s tongue began<br/>
To call the Sieur De Blois an alter’d man;<br/>
With curious mien he oft would pace along<br/>
The village street, and eye the gaping throng.<br/>
Yet whilst he shew’d himself as ne’er before,<br/>
His wild-eyed lady was observ’d no more.<br/>
In course of time, ’twas scarce thought odd or ill<br/>
That he his ears with village lore should fill;<br/>
Nor was the town with special rumour rife<br/>
When he sought out the bailiff and his wife:<br/>
Their tale of sorrow, with its ghastly end,<br/>
Was told, indeed, by ev’ry wond’ring friend.<br/>
The Sieur heard all, and low’ring rode away,<br/>
Nor was he seen again for many a day.<br/><br/>

When vernal sunshine shed its cheering glow,<br/>
And genial zephyrs blew away the snow,<br/>
To frighten’d swains a horror was reveal’d<br/>
In the damp herbage of a melting field.<br/>
There (half preserv’d by winter’s frigid bed)<br/>
Lay the dark Dame De Blois, untimely dead;<br/>
By some assassin’s stroke most foully slain,<br/>
Her shapely brow and temples cleft in twain.<br/>
Reluctant hands the dismal burden bore<br/>
To the stone arches of the husband’s door,<br/>
Where silent serfs the ghastly thing receiv’d,<br/>
Trembling with fright, but less amaz’d than griev’d;<br/>
The Sieur his dame beheld with blazing eyes,<br/>
And shook with anger, more than with surprise.<br/>
(At least ’tis thus the stupid peasants told<br/>
Their wide-mouth’d wives when they the tale unroll’d.)<br/>
The village wonder’d why De Blois had kept<br/>
His spouse’s loss unmention’d and unwept,<br/>
Nor were there lacking sland’rous tongues to claim<br/>
That the dark master was himself to blame.<br/>
But village talk could scarcely hope to solve<br/>
A crime so deep, and thus the months revolve:<br/>
The rural train repeat the gruesome tale,<br/>
And gape and marvel more than they bewail.<br/><br/>

Swift flew the sun, and winter once again<br/>
With icy talons gripp’d the frigid plain.<br/>
December brought its store of Christmas cheer,<br/>
And grateful peasants hail’d the op’ning year;<br/>
But by the hearth as Candlemas drew nigh,<br/>
The whisp’ring ancients spoke of things gone by.<br/>
Few had forgot the dark demoniac lore<br/>
Of things that came the Candlemas before,<br/>
And many a crone intently eyed the house<br/>
Where dwelt the sadden’d bailiff and his spouse.<br/>
At last the day arriv’d, the sky o’erspread<br/>
With dark’ning messengers and clouds of lead;<br/>
Each neighb’ring grove Aeolian warnings sigh’d,<br/>
And thick’ning terrors broadcast seem’d to bide.<br/>
The good folk, tho’ they knew not why, would run<br/>
Swift past the bailiff’s door, the scene to shun;<br/>
Within the house the grieving couple wept,<br/>
And mourn’d the child who now forever slept.<br/>
On rush’d the dusk in doubly hideous form,<br/>
Borne on the pinions of the gath’ring storm;<br/>
Unusual murmurs fill’d the rainless wind,<br/>
The rising river lash’d the troubled shore;<br/>
Black thro’ the night the awful storm-god prowl’d,<br/>
And froze the list’ners’ life-blood as he howl’d;<br/>
Gigantic trees like supple rushes sway’d,<br/>
Whilst for his home the trembling cotter pray’d.<br/>
Now falls a sudden lull amidst the gale;<br/>
With less’ning force the circling currents wail;<br/>
Far down the stream that laves the neighb’ring mead<br/>
Burst a new ululation, wildly key’d;<br/>
The peasant train a frantic mien assume,<br/>
And huddle closer in the spectral gloom:<br/>
To each strain’d ear the truth too well is known,<br/>
For that dread sound can come from wolves alone!<br/>
The rustics close attend, when ere they think,<br/>
A lupine army swarms the river’s brink;<br/>
From out the waters leap a howling train<br/>
That rend the air, and scatter o’er the plain:<br/>
With flaming orbs the frothing creatures fly,<br/>
And chant with hellish voice their hungry cry.<br/>
First of the pack a mighty monster leaps<br/>
With fearless tread, and martial order keeps;<br/>
Th’ attendant wolves his yelping tones obey,<br/>
And form in columns for the coming fray:<br/>
No frighten’d swain they harm, but silent bound<br/>
With a fix’d purpose o’er the frozen ground.<br/>
Straight course the monsters thro’ the village street,<br/>
Unholy vigour in their flying feet;<br/>
Thro’ half-shut blinds the shelter’d peasants peer,<br/>
And wax in wonder as they lose in fear.<br/>
Th’ excited pack at last their goal perceive,<br/>
And the vex’d air with deaf’ning clamour cleave;<br/>
The churls, astonish’d, watch th’ unnatural herd<br/>
Flock round a cottage at the leader’s word:<br/>
Quick spreads the fearsome fact, by rumour blown,<br/>
That the doom’d cottage is the bailiff’s own!<br/>
Round and around the howling daemons glide,<br/>
Whilst the fierce leader scales the vine-clad side;<br/>
The frantic wind its horrid wail renews,<br/>
And mutters madly thro’ the lifeless yews.<br/>
In the frail house the bailiff calmly waits<br/>
The rav’ning horde, and trusts th’ impartial Fates,<br/>
But the wan wife revives with curious mien<br/>
Another monster and an older scene;<br/>
Amidst th’ increasing wind that rocks the walls,<br/>
The dame to him the serpent’s deed recalls:<br/>
Then as a nameless thought fills both their minds,<br/>
The bare-fang’d leader crashes thro’ the blinds.<br/>
Across the room, with murd’rous fury rife,<br/>
Leaps the mad wolf, and seizes on the wife;<br/>
With strange intent he drags his shrieking prey<br/>
Close to the spot where once the coffin lay.<br/>
Wilder and wilder roars the mounting gale<br/>
That sweeps the hills and hurtles thro’ the vale;<br/>
The ill-made cottage shakes, the pack without<br/>
Dance with new fury in demoniac rout.<br/>
Quick as his thought, the valiant bailiff stands<br/>
Above the wolf, a weapon in his hands;<br/>
The ready axe that serv’d a year before,<br/>
Now serves as well to slay one monster more.<br/>
The creature drops inert, with shatter’d head,<br/>
Full on the floor, and silent as the dead;<br/>
The rescu’d wife recalls the dire alarms,<br/>
And faints from terror in her husband’s arms.<br/>
But as he holds her, all the cottage quakes,<br/>
And with full force the titan tempest breaks:<br/>
Down crash the walls, and o’er their shrinking forms<br/>
Burst the mad revels of the storm of storms.<br/>
Th’ encircling wolves advance with ghastly pace,<br/>
Hunger and murder in each gleaming face,<br/>
But as they close, from out the hideous night<br/>
Flashes a bolt of unexpected light:<br/>
The vivid scene to ev’ry eye appears,<br/>
And peasants shiver with returning fears.<br/>
Above the wreck the scatheless chimney stays,<br/>
Its outline glimm’ring in the fitful rays,<br/>
Whilst o’er the hearth still hangs the household shrine,<br/>
The Saviour’s image and the Cross divine!<br/>
Round the blest spot a lambent radiance glows,<br/>
And shields the cotters from their stealthy foes:<br/>
Each monstrous creature marks the wondrous glare,<br/>
Drops, fades, and vanishes in empty air!<br/>
The village train with startled eyes adore,<br/>
And count their beads in rev’rence o’er and o’er.<br/>
Now fades the light, and dies the raging blast,<br/>
The hour of dread and reign of horror past.<br/>
Pallid and bruis’d, from out his toppled walls<br/>
The panting bailiff with his good wife crawls:<br/>
Kind hands attend them, whilst o’er all the town<br/>
A strange sweet peace of spirit settles down.<br/>
Wonder and fear are still’d in soothing sleep,<br/>
As thro’ the breaking clouds the moon rays peep.<br/><br/>

Here paus’d the prattling grandam in her speech,<br/>
Confus’d with age, the tale half out of reach;<br/>
The list’ning guest, impatient for a clue,<br/>
Fears ’tis not one tale, but a blend of two;<br/>
He fain would know how far’d the widow’d lord<br/>
Whose eerie ways th’ initial theme afford,<br/>
And marvels that the crone so quick should slight<br/>
His fate, to babble of the wolf-wrack’d night.<br/>
The old wife, press’d, for greater clearness strives,<br/>
Nods wisely, and her scatter’d wits revives;<br/>
Yet strangely lingers on her latter tale<br/>
Of wolf and bailiff, miracle and gale.<br/>
When (quoth the crone) the dawn’s bright radiance bath’d<br/>
Th’ eventful scene, so late in terror swath’d,<br/>
The chatt’ring churls that sought the ruin’d cot<br/>
Found a new marvel in the gruesome spot.<br/>
From fallen walls a trail of gory red,<br/>
As of the stricken wolf, erratic led;<br/>
O’er road and mead the new-dript crimson wound,<br/>
Till lost amidst the neighb’ring swampy ground:<br/>
With wonder unappeas’d the peasants burn’d,<br/>
For what the quicksand takes is ne’er return’d.<br/><br/>

Once more the grandam, with a knowing eye,<br/>
Stops in her tale, to watch a hawk soar by;<br/>
The weary list’ner, baffled, seeks anew<br/>
For some plain statement, or enlight’ning clue.<br/>
Th’ indulgent crone attends the puzzled plea,<br/>
Yet strangely mutters o’er the mystery.<br/>
The Sieur?  Ah, yes—that morning all in vain<br/>
His shaking servants scour’d the frozen plain;<br/>
No man had seen him since he rode away<br/>
In silence on the dark preceding day.<br/>
His horse, wild-eyed with some unusual fright,<br/>
Came wand’ring from the river-bank that night.<br/>
His hunting-hound, that mourn’d with piteous woe,<br/>
Howl’d by the quicksand swamp, his grief to shew.<br/>
The village folk thought much, but utter’d less;<br/>
The servants’ search wore out in emptiness:<br/>
For Sieur De Blois (the old wife’s tale is o’er)<br/>
Was lost to mortal sight for evermore.
