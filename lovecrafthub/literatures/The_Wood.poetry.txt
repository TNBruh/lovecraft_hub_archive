They cut it down, and where the pitch-black aisles<br>
&emsp;Of forest night had hid eternal things,<br>
They scal’d the sky with tow’rs and marble piles<br>
&emsp;To make a city for their revellings.<br><br/>

White and amazing to the lands around<br/>
&emsp;That wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose;<br/>
Crystal and ivory, sublimely crown’d<br/>
&emsp;With pinnacles that bore unmelting snows.<br/><br/>

And through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang,<br/>
&emsp;While wine and riot brought their scarlet stains;<br/>
Never a voice of elder marvels sang,<br/>
&emsp;Nor any eye call’d up the hills and plains.<br/><br/>

Thus down the years, till on one purple night<br/>
&emsp;A drunken minstrel in his careless verse<br/>
Spoke the vile words that should not see the light,<br/>
&emsp;And stirr’d the shadows of an ancient curse.<br/><br/>

Forests may fall, but not the dusk they shield;<br/>
&emsp;So on the spot where that proud city stood,<br/>
The shuddering dawn no single stone reveal’d,<br/>
&emsp;But fled the blackness of a primal wood.
