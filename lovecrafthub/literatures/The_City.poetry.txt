&emsp;It was golden and splendid,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;That City of light;<br>
&emsp;A vision suspended<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In deeps of the night;<br>
A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I remember the season<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;It dawn’d on my gaze;<br/>
&emsp;The mad time of unreason,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The brain-numbing days<br/>
When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze.<br/><br/>
&emsp;More lovely than Zion<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;It shone in the sky,<br/>
&emsp;When the beams of Orion<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Beclouded my eye,<br/>
Bringing sleep that was fill’d with dim mem’ries of moments obscure and gone by.<br/><br/>
&emsp;Its mansions were stately<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;With carvings made fair,<br/>
&emsp;Each rising sedately<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;On terraces rare,<br/>
And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming there.<br/><br/>
&emsp;The avenues lur’d me<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;With vistas sublime;<br/>
&emsp;Tall arches assur’d me<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That once on a time<br/>
I had wander’d in rapture beneath them, and bask’d in the Halcyon clime.<br/><br/>
&emsp;On the plazas were standing<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;A sculptur’d array;<br/>
&emsp;Long-bearded, commanding,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Grave men in their day—<br/>
But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face batter’d away.<br/><br/>
&emsp;In that city effulgent<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;No mortal I saw;<br/>
&emsp;But my fancy, indulgent<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;To memory’s law,<br/>
Linger’d long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with awe.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I fann’d the faint ember<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That glow’d in my mind,<br/>
&emsp;And strove to remember<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The aeons behind;<br/>
To rove thro’ infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin’d.<br/><br/>
&emsp;Then the horrible warning<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Upon my soul sped<br/>
&emsp;Like the ominous morning<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That rises in red,<br/>
And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead.
