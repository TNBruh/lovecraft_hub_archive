How dull the wretch, whose philosophic mind<br>
Disdains the pleasures of fantastic kind;<br>
Whose prosy thoughts the joys of life exclude,<br>
And wreck the solace of the poet’s mood!<br>
Young Zeno, practic’d in the Stoic’s art,<br/>
Rejects the language of the glowing heart;<br/>
Dissolves sweet Nature to a mess of laws;<br/>
Condemns th’ effect whilst looking for the cause;<br/>
Freezes poor Ovid in an ic’d review,<br/>
And sneers because his fables are untrue!<br/>
In search of Truth the hopeful zealot goes,<br/>
But all the sadder tums, the more he knows!<br/>
Stay! vandal sophist, whose deep lore would blast<br/>
The graceful legends of the story’d past;<br/>
Whose tongue in censure flays th’ embellish’d page,<br/>
And scolds the comforts of a dreary age:<br/>
Would’st strip the foliage from the vital bough<br/>
Till all men grow as wisely dull as thou?<br/>
Happy the man whose fresh, untainted eye<br/>
Discerns a Pantheon in the spangled sky;<br/>
Finds Sylphs and Dryads in the waving trees,<br/>
And spies soft Notus in the southern breeze;<br/>
For whom the stream a cheering carol sings,<br/>
While reedy music by the fountain rings;<br/>
To whom the waves a Nereid tale confide<br/>
Till friendly presence fills the rising tide.<br/>
Happy is he, who void of learning’s woes,<br/>
Th’ ethereal life of body’d Nature knows:<br/>
I scorn the sage that tells me it but seems,<br/>
And flout his gravity in sunlit dreams!<br/>
