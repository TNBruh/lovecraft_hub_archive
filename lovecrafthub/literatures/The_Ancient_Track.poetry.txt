There was no hand to hold me back<br>
That night I found the ancient track<br>
Over the hill, and strained to see<br>
The fields that teased my memory.<br>
This tree, that wall—I knew them well,<br/>
And all the roofs and orchards fell<br/>
Familiarly upon my mind<br/>
As from a past not far behind.<br/>
I knew what shadows would be cast<br/>
When the late moon came up at last<br/>
From back of Zaman’s Hill, and how<br/>
The vale would shine three hours from now.<br/>
And when the path grew steep and high,<br/>
And seemed to end against the sky,<br/>
I had no fear of what might rest<br/>
Beyond that silhouetted crest.<br/>
Straight on I walked, while all the night<br/>
Grew pale with phosphorescent light,<br/>
And wall and farmhouse gable glowed<br/>
Unearthly by the climbing road.<br/>
There was the milestone that I knew—<br/>
“Two miles to Dunwich”—now the view<br/>
Of distant spire and roofs would dawn<br/>
With ten more upward paces gone. . . .<br/><br/>

There was no hand to hold me back<br/>
That night I found the ancient track,<br/>
And reached the crest to see outspread<br/>
A valley of the lost and dead:<br/>
And over Zaman’s Hill the horn<br/>
Of a malignant moon was born,<br/>
To light the weeds and vines that grew<br/>
On ruined walls I never knew.<br/>
The fox-fire glowed in field and bog,<br/>
And unknown waters spewed a fog<br/>
Whose curling talons mocked the thought<br/>
That I had ever known this spot.<br/>
Too well I saw from the mad scene<br/>
That my loved past had never been—<br/>
Nor was I now upon the trail<br/>
Descending to that long-dead vale.<br/>
Around was fog—ahead, the spray<br/>
Of star-streams in the Milky Way. . . .<br/>
There was no hand to hold me back<br/>
That night I found the ancient track.<br/>
