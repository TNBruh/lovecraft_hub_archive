&emsp;’Tis a grove-circled dwelling<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Set close to a hill,<br>
&emsp;Where the branches are telling<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Strange legends of ill;<br>
&emsp;Over timbers so old<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That they breathe of the dead,<br/>
&emsp;Crawl the vines, green and cold,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;By strange nourishment fed;<br/>
And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank slimy bed.<br/><br/>
&emsp;In the gardens are growing<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Tall blossoms and fair,<br/>
&emsp;Each pallid bloom throwing<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Perfume on the air;<br/>
&emsp;But the afternoon sun<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;With its shining red rays<br/>
&emsp;Makes the picture loom dun<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;On the curious gaze,<br/>
And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless days.<br/><br/>
&emsp;The rank grasses are waving<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;On terrace and lawn,<br/>
&emsp;Dim memories sav’ring<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Of things that have gone;<br/>
&emsp;The stones of the walks<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Are encrusted and wet,<br/>
&emsp;And a strange spirit stalks<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;When the red sun has set,<br/>
And the soul of the watcher is fill’d with faint pictures he fain would forget.<br/><br/>
&emsp;It was in the hot Junetime<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I stood by that scene,<br/>
&emsp;When the gold rays of noontime<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Beat bright on the green.<br/>
&emsp;But I shiver’d with cold,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Groping feebly for light,<br/>
&emsp;As a picture unroll’d—<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And my age-spanning sight<br/>
Saw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the night.
