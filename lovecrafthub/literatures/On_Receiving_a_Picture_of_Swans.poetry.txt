With pensive grace the melancholy Swan<br>
Mourns o’er the tomb of luckless Phaëton;<br>
On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave,<br>
And guard with tender care the wat’ry grave.<br>
Would that I might, should I too proudly claim<br/>
An Heav’nly parent, or a Godlike fame,<br/>
When flown too high, and dash’d to depths below,<br/>
Receive such tribute as a Cygnus’ woe!<br/>
The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along,<br/>
Sighs all the deeper for his want of song.
