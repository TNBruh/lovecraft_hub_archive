As Columbia’s brave scions, in anger array’d,<br>
&emsp;Once defy’d a proud monarch and built a new nation;<br>
’Gainst their brothers of Britain unsheath’d the sharp blade<br>
&emsp;That hath ne’er met defeat nor endur’d desecration;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;So must we in this hour<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Show our valour and pow’r,<br/>
And dispel the black perils that over us low’r:<br/>
&emsp;Whilst the sons of Britannia, no longer our foes,<br/>
&emsp;Will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows!<br/><br/>

See the banners of Liberty float in the breeze<br/>
&emsp;That plays light o’er the regions our fathers defended;<br/>
Hear the voice of the million resound o’er the leas,<br/>
&emsp;As the deeds of the past are proclaim’d and commended;<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And in splendour on high<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Where our flags proudly fly,<br/>
See the folds we tore down flung again to the sky:<br/>
&emsp;For the Emblem of England, in kinship unfurl’d,<br/>
&emsp;Shall divide with Old Glory the praise of the world!<br/><br/>

Bury’d now are the hatreds of subject and King,<br/>
&emsp;And the strife that once sunder’d an Empire hath vanish’d.<br/>
With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring<br/>
&emsp;As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish’d;<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And the broad British sea,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Of her enemies free,<br/>
Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee:<br/>
&emsp;For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side,<br/>
&emsp;Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!
