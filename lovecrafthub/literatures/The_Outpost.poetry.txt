When evening cools the yellow stream,<br>
&emsp;And shadows stalk the jungle’s ways,<br>
&emsp;Zimbabwe’s palace flares ablaze<br>
For a great King who fears to dream.<br><br/>

For he alone of all mankind<br/>
&emsp;Waded the swamp that serpents shun;<br/>
&emsp;And struggling toward the setting sun,<br/>
Came on the veldt that lies behind.<br/><br/>

No other eyes had vented there<br/>
&emsp;Since eyes were lent for human sight—<br/>
&emsp;But there, as sunset turned to night,<br/>
He found the Elder Secret’s lair.<br/><br/>

Strange turrets rose beyond the plain,<br/>
&emsp;And walls and bastions spread around<br/>
&emsp;The distant domes that fouled the ground<br/>
Like leprous fungi after rain.<br/><br/>

A grudging moon writhed up to shine<br/>
&emsp;Past leagues where life can have no home;<br/>
&emsp;And paling far-off tower and dome,<br/>
Shewed each unwindowed and malign.<br/><br/>

Then he who in his boyhood ran<br/>
&emsp;Through vine-hung ruins free of fear,<br/>
&emsp;Trembled at what he saw—for here<br/>
Was no dead, ruined seat of man.<br/><br/>

Inhuman shapes, half-seen, half-guessed,<br/>
&emsp;Half solid and half ether-spawned,<br/>
&emsp;Seethed down from starless voids that yawned<br/>
In heav’n, to these blank walls of pest.<br/><br/>

And voidward from that pest-mad zone<br/>
&emsp;Amorphous hordes seethed darkly back,<br/>
&emsp;Their dim claws laden with the wrack<br/>
Of things that men have dreamed and known.<br/><br/>

The ancient Fishers from Outside—<br/>
&emsp;Were there not tales the high-priest told,<br/>
&emsp;Of how they found the worlds of old,<br/>
And took what pelf their fancy spied?<br/><br/>

Their hidden, dread-ringed outposts brood<br/>
&emsp;Upon a million worlds of space;<br/>
&emsp;Abhorred by every living race,<br/>
Yet scatheless in their solitude.<br/><br/>

Sweating with fright, the watcher crept<br/>
&emsp;Back to the swamp that serpents shun,<br/>
&emsp;So that he lay, by rise of sun,<br/>
Safe in the palace where he slept.<br/><br/>

None saw him leave, or come at dawn,<br/>
&emsp;Nor does his flesh bear any mark<br/>
&emsp;Of what he met in that curst dark—<br/>
Yet from his sleep all peace has gone.<br/><br/>

When evening cools the yellow stream,<br/>
&emsp;And shadows stalk the jungle’s ways,<br/>
&emsp;Zimbabwe’s palace flares ablaze,<br/>
For a great King who fears to dream.
