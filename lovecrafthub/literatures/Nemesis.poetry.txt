&emsp;Thro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Past the wan-moon’d abysses of night,<br>
&emsp;I have liv’d o’er my lives without number,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;I have sounded all things with my sight;<br>
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have whirl’d with the earth at the dawning,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;When the sky was a vaporous flame;<br/>
&emsp;I have seen the dark universe yawning,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Where the black planets roll without aim;<br/>
Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I had drifted o’er seas without ending,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Under sinister grey-clouded skies<br/>
&emsp;That the many-fork’d lightning is rending,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That resound with hysterical cries;<br/>
With the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have plung’d like a deer thro’ the arches<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Of the hoary primordial grove,<br/>
&emsp;Where the oaks feel the presence that marches<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And stalks on where no spirit dares rove;<br/>
And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers thro’ dead branches above.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That rise barren and bleak from the plain,<br/>
&emsp;I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That ooze down to the marsh and the main;<br/>
And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things I care not to gaze on again.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have scann’d the vast ivy-clad palace,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I have trod its untenanted hall,<br/>
&emsp;Where the moon writhing up from the valleys<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Shews the tapestried things on the wall;<br/>
Strange figures discordantly woven, which I cannot endure to recall.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have peer’d from the casement in wonder<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;At the mouldering meadows around,<br/>
&emsp;At the many-roof’d village laid under<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The curse of a grave-girdled ground;<br/>
And from rows of white urn-carven marble I listen intently for sound.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I have haunted the tombs of the ages,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I have flown on the pinions of fear<br/>
&emsp;Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:<br/>
And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I was old when the Pharaohs first mounted<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The jewel-deck’d throne by the Nile;<br/>
&emsp;I was old in those epochs uncounted<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;When I, and I only, was vile;<br/>
And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle.<br/><br/>
&emsp;Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And great is the reach of its doom;<br/>
&emsp;Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Nor can respite be found in the tomb:<br/>
Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.<br/><br/>
<i>&emsp;Thro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Past the wan-moon’d abysses of night,<br/>
&emsp;I have liv’d o’er my lives without number,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I have sounded all things with my sight;<br/>
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.</i>
