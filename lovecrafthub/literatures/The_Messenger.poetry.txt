To Bertrand K. Hart, Esq.<br><br>

The thing, he said, would come that night at three<br>
From the old churchyard on the hill below;<br>
But crouching by an oak fire’s wholesome glow,<br/>
I tried to tell myself it could not be.<br/>
Surely, I mused, it was a pleasantry<br/>
Devised by one who did not truly know<br/>
The Elder Sign, bequeathed from long ago,<br/>
That sets the fumbling forms of darkness free.<br/><br/>

He had not meant it—no—but still I lit<br/>
Another lamp as starry Leo climbed<br/>
Out of the Seekonk, and a steeple chimed<br/>
Three—and the firelight faded, bit by bit.<br/>
Then at the door that cautious rattling came—<br/>
And the mad truth devoured me like a flame!
