The vicar sat in the firelight’s glow,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;A volume in his hand;<br>
&emsp;And a tear he shed for the widespread woe,<br>
&emsp;And the anguish brought by the vicious foe<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That overran the land.<br/><br/>

But ne’er a hand for his King rais’d he,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;For he was a man of peace;<br/>
&emsp;And he car’d not a whit for the victory<br/>
&emsp;That must come to preserve his nation free,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And the world from fear release.<br/><br/>

His son had buckled on his sword,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The first at the front was he;<br/>
&emsp;But the vicar his valiant child ignor’d,<br/>
&emsp;And his noble deeds in the field deplor’d,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;For he knew not bravery.<br/><br/>

On his flock he strove to fix his will,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And lead them to scorn the fray.<br/>
&emsp;He told them that conquest brings but ill;<br/>
&emsp;That meek submission would serve them still<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;To keep the foe away.<br/><br/>

In vain did he hear the bugle’s sound<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;That strove to avert the fall.<br/>
&emsp;The land, quoth he, is all men’s ground,<br/>
&emsp;What matter if friend or foe be found<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;As master of us all?<br/><br/>

One day from the village green hard by<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The vicar heard a roar<br/>
&emsp;Of cannon that rivall’d the anguish’d cry<br/>
&emsp;Of the hundreds that liv’d, but wish’d to die<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;As the enemy rode them o’er.<br/><br/>

Now he sees his own cathedral shake<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;At the foeman’s wanton aim.<br/>
&emsp;The ancient tow’rs with the bullets quake;<br/>
&emsp;The steeples fall, the foundations break,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And the whole is lost in flame.<br/><br/>

Up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And the vicar, and daughter, and wife<br/>
&emsp;Scream out in vain for the needed aid<br/>
&emsp;That only a regiment might have made<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Ere they lose what is more than life.<br/><br/>

Then quick to his brain came manhood’s thought,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;As he saw his erring course;<br/>
&emsp;And the vicar his dusty rifle brought<br/>
&emsp;That the foe might at least by one be fought,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And force repaid with force.<br/><br/>

One shot—the enemy’s blasting fire<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;A breach in the wall cuts thro’,<br/>
&emsp;But the vicar replies with his waken’d ire;<br/>
&emsp;Fells one arm’d brute for each fallen spire,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And in blood is born anew.<br/><br/>

Two shots—the wife and daughter sink,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Each with a mortal wound;<br/>
&emsp;And the vicar, too madden’d by far to think,<br/>
&emsp;Rushes boldly on to death’s vague brink,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;With the manhood he has found.<br/><br/>

Three shots—but shots of another kind<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The smoky regions rend;<br/>
&emsp;And upon the foeman with rage gone blind,<br/>
&emsp;Like a ceaseless, resistless, avenging wind,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The rescuing troops descend.<br/><br/>

The smoke-pall clears, and the vicar’s son<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;His father’s life has sav’d;<br/>
&emsp;And the vicar looks o’er the ruin done,<br/>
&emsp;Ere the vict’ry by his child was won,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;His face with care engrav’d.<br/><br/>

The vicar sat in the firelight’s glow,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The volume in his hand,<br/>
&emsp;That brought to his hearth the bitter woe<br/>
&emsp;Which only a husband and father can know,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;And truly understand.<br/><br/>

With a chasten’d mien he flung the book<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;To the leaping flames before;<br/>
&emsp;And a breath of sad relief he took<br/>
&emsp;As the pages blacken’d beneath his look—<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The fool of Peace no more!<br/><br/><br/>
<b><i>Epilogue</i></b><br/><br/>

The rev’rend parson, wak’d to man’s estate,<br/>
Laments his wife’s and daughter’s common fate.<br/>
His martial son in warm embrace enfolds,<br/>
And clings the tighter to the child he holds.<br/>
His peaceful notions, banish’d in an hour,<br/>
Will nevermore his wit or sense devour;<br/>
But steep’d in truth, ’tis now his nobler plan<br/>
To cure, yet recognise, the faults of man.
